I was provided with the starter code for treasure maze environment. The code that was provided was called the TreasureMaze and the GameExperience classes. The code that was provided defined how the maze operated and how the agent interacted with the environment. I created several parts of the codes myself. I refined teh buil_model() function. I worte the training function (qtrain). Computer scientist design and implement computational solutions. As a computer scientist, I approach by breaking down problems into smaller problems. My ethical responsibiliteis to the end user and organization is to make software safe and reliable.
